    "Here's how you can perform the F-test:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set up the hypotheses:\n",
    "   - Null hypothesis (H0): σA² = σB² (the population variances are equal).\n",
    "   - Alternative hypothesis (H1): σA² ≠ σB² (the population variances are not equal).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Calculate the sample variances for each group:\n",
    "   - Sample variance for Group A (sA²) ≈ 16.33 (you can calculate it using the formula for sample variance).\n",
    "   - Sample variance for Group B (sB²) ≈ 5.33 (you can calculate it using the formula for sample variance).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Determine the degrees of freedom for the numerator and denominator:\n",
    "   - Degrees of freedom for the numerator (dfn) is 5 (for Group A).\n",
    "   - Degrees of freedom for the denominator (dfd) is 5 (for Group B).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Calculate the F-statistic using the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "   F = (larger sample variance) / (smaller sample variance)\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this case, the larger sample variance is approximately 16.33 (from Group A), and the smaller sample variance is approximately 5.33 (from Group B), so:\n",
    "\n",
    "   F ≈ 16.33 / 5.33 ≈ 3.06\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Find the critical F-value for a two-tailed test at the 1% significance level. You can use an F-table or an online calculator to find the critical value. For α = 0.01, dfn = 5 and dfd = 5, the critical F-value is approximately 9.966.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Compare the calculated F-statistic to the critical F-value:\n",
    "   - If F-statistic > critical F-value, reject the null hypothesis (H0).\n",
    "   - If F-statistic ≤ critical F-value, fail to reject the null hypothesis (H0).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the calculated F-statistic (approximately 3.06) is less than the critical F-value (approximately 9.966), so you would fail to reject the null hypothesis. This means that at the 1% significance level, there is not enough evidence to conclude that the population variances of test scores in Group A and Group B are significantly different."
